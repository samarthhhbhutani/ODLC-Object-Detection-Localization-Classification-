# Object Detection Localisation and Classification

This repository contains the code for an autonomous aerial system that detects and reads text on ground targets using an in-house Region Proposal Network (RPN), geotagging, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

It utilized Wide ResNet-50 for Optical Character Recognition and Detecting colour and YOLO V8 for Region Proposal.
